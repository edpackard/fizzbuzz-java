# Java Fizzbuzz

I am teaching myself Java basics with TDD by working through the Fizzbuzz kata.

>Your task is to test-drive a program that takes a max number 
> and returns a string. The string should list out the numbers 
> counting up to and including the given max number, substituting 
> Fizz where the number is divisible by 3, Buzz where it is divisible 
> by 5, and FizzBuzz where it is divisible by both 3 and 5.
> Here's an example:

```
CALLING:
  fizzbuzz(15)
SHOULD RETURN:
  "1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz"
```
